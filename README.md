# APT Emulation Framework

A comprehensive Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) emulation system designed for penetration testing and red team engagements. This framework simulates realistic APT behaviors and techniques mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER

**FOR AUTHORIZED TESTING ONLY**

This tool is designed exclusively for authorized penetration testing, red team exercises, and security research. Users must:

- Have explicit written authorization before deployment
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Use only in controlled, authorized environments
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and may violate local, state, and federal laws.

## 🎯 Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Stealth Operations**: Process masquerading, anti-VM detection, silent execution
- **Advanced Persistence**: Registry keys, scheduled tasks, startup folders, services
- **Enhanced C2**: HTTPS communication, DNS tunneling, encryption, jitter
- **Comprehensive Reconnaissance**: System, network, security software discovery
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Technique logging and mapping
- **Modular Architecture**: Plugin-based system for extensibility

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd apt_emulator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the system**
   ```bash
   # Edit config.py to set your C2 server and preferences
   nano config.py
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Execution

**Full APT Emulator:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Lightweight Payload:**
```bash
python payload.py
```

### Configuration Options

Edit [`config.py`](config.py) to customize:

```python
# Operational Security
SILENT_MODE = True          # Disable debug output
DEBUG_MODE = False          # Enable debugging
PROCESS_NAME_MASQUERADE = "svchost.exe"  # Process name

# C2 Configuration
C2_SERVER = 'https://your-c2-server.com/api'
TRANSMISSION_INTERVAL = 900  # 15 minutes

# Stealth Settings
JITTER_MIN = 1              # Minimum delay
JITTER_MAX = 5              # Maximum delay
```

## Core Modules

### Stealth Manager (`core/stealth.py`)

## APT Simulation Profiles

The framework supports simulation of different APT groups:

### APT29 (Cozy Bear)
- Focus: Stealth, PowerShell, Living-off-the-Land
- Techniques: T1059.001, T1027, T1071.001, T1055
